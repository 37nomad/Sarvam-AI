This provision was made in the Patents (Amendment) Act of 1999. Copyright protection in India India has one of the most modern copyright protection laws in the world. Major development in the area of copyright during 1999 was the amendment to the Copyright Act of 1957 to make it fully compatible with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement. Called the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999, this amendment was signed by the President of India on December 30, 1999 and came into force on January 15, 2000. The earlier 1994 amendment to the Copyright Act of 1957 had provided protection to all original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, cinematography, films and sound recordings. It also brought sectors such as satellite broadcasting, computer software and digital technology under Indian copyright protection. The Copyright Act is now in full conformity with the TRIPS obligations. Concern has been expressed about the allegedly slow judicial system in India and the procedural issues involved in trial and conviction. The Indian judiciary is handling cases as expeditiously as possible. The year that has gone by has again witnessed the versatility of the impartial and independent interpretation of intellectual property rights, amplified by the tion of intellectual property rights, amplified by the gaps in the statute with the common sense of the common law. Indian enforcement agencies are working effectively and there is a decline in the levels of piracy in India. A summary of these measures is given below: 1. During the year the government continued to stress the need for strict enforcement of the Copyright Act and Rules. State governments and other Ministries were regularly requested to lay special attention to ensuring copyright protection in their functioning. The Government also brought out a Handbook of Copyright Law to create awareness about copyright right amongst the stakeholders, enforcement agencies, professional users like the scientific and academic communities and members of the public. Copies of the Handbook were circulated free of cost to the state and central government officials and police personnel and also provided to participants in various seminars and workshops on IPR matters held during the year. National Police Academy and National Academy of Customs, Excise and Narcotics conducted several training programs on copyright for the police and customs officers. Modules on copyright have been included in their regular training programs. The Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has initiated several measures in the past for strengthening the enforcement of copyrights that include constitution of a Copyright Enforcement Advisory Council (CEAC), creation of separate cells in state police headquarters, encouraging setting up of collective administration societies and organization of seminars and workshops to create greater awareness about copyright law among the enforcement personnel and the general public. For collective administration of copyright, copyright societies have been set up for different classes of works. At present there are three registered copyright societies. These are the Society for Copyright Regulations (SCRIPT) for cinematography films, Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (IPRS) for musical works and Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) for sound recordings. These societies, particularly the PPL and the IPRS, have been quite active in anti-piracy work. The PPL has even set up a special anti-piracy cell under a retired Director General of Police, and this cell has been working in tandem with the police. Several other measures to create general awareness about copyright and for encouraging study of intellectual property rights in the educational system, besides modernizing the Copyright Of- fice, are on the anvil. Consequent to the number of measures initiated by the government, there has been more activity in the enforcement of copyright laws in the country during the last year compared to previous years. As per the data relating to copyright offenses available with the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of copy- right cases registered has gone up from 479 in 1997 to 802 in 1998. The number of persons arrested has increased from 794 in 1997 to 980 in 1998. The value of seizures has gone up from Rs. 28.8 million in 1997 to Rs. 74.8 million in 1998. These figures reflect the general improvement in the enforcement of the copyright law.

This pro-\nvision was made in the Patents (Amendment) Act\nof 1999.\n\nCopyright protection in India\n\nIndia has one of the most modern copyright protec-\ntion laws in the world. Major development in the\narea of copyright during 1999 was the amendment\nto the Copyright Act of 1957 to make it fully compat-\nible with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.\nCalled the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999, this\namendment was signed by the President of India on\nDecember 30, 1999 and came into force on January\n15, 2000.\n\nThe earlier 1994 amendment to the Copyright Act of\n1957 had provided protection to all original literary,\ndramatic, musical and artistic works, cinematogra-\nphy, films and sound recordings. It also brought\nsectors such as satellite broadcasting, computer soft-\nware and digital technology under Indian copyright\nprotection. The Copyright Act is now in full confor-\nmity with the TRIPS obligations.\n\nConcern has been expressed about the allegedly\nslow judicial system in India and the procedural\nissues involved in trial and conviction. The Indian\njudiciary is handling cases as expeditiously as pos-\nsible. The year that has gone by has again witnessed\nthe versatility of the impartial and independent In-\ndian judiciary when it comes to the issue of protec-\ntion of intellectual property rights, amplified by the\nencouraging trends with Indian courts plugging in\ngaps in the statute with the common sense of the\ncommon law.\n\nIndian enforcement agencies are working effectively\nand there is a decline in the levels of piracy in India.\nA summary of these measures is given below:\n\n1. During the year the government continued to stress\nthe need for strict enforcement of the Copyright\nAct and Rules. State governments and other Min-\nistries were regularly requested to lay special at-\ntention to ensuring copyright protection in their\nfunctioning.\n\n2. The Government also brought out a Handbook of\nCopyright Law to create awareness about copy-\nright amongst the stakeholders, enforcement agen-\ncies, professional users like the scientific and aca-\ndemic communities and members of the public.\nCopies of the Handbook were circulated free of\ncost to the state and central government officials\n\nand police personnel and also provided to partici-\npants in various seminars and workshops on IPR\nmatters held during the year.\n\n3. National Police Academy and National Academy\nof Customs, Excise and Narcotics conducted sev-\neral training programs on copyright for the police\nand customs officers. Modules on copyright have\nbeen included in their regular training programs.\n\n4. The Department of Education, Ministry of Human\nResource Development, Government of India has\ninitiated several measures in the past for strength-\nening the enforcement of copyrights that include\nconstitution of a Copyright Enforcement Advisory\nCouncil (CEAC), creation of separate cells in state\npolice headquarters, encouraging setting up of\ncollective administration societies and organiza-\ntion of seminars and workshops to create greater\nawareness about copyright law among the en-\nforcement personnel and the general public.\n\n5. For collective administration of copyright, copy-\nright societies have been set up for different classes\nof works. At present there are three registered\ncopyright societies. These are the Society for\nCopyright Regulations of Indian Producers of Films\n& Television (SCRIPT) for cinematography films,\nIndian Performing Rights Society Limited (IPRS)\nfor musical works and Phonographic Performance\nLimited (PPL) for sound recordings. These societ-\nies, particularly the PPL and the IPRS, have been\nquite active in anti-piracy work. The PPL has even\nset up a special anti-piracy cell under a retired\nDirector General of Police, and this cell has been\nworking in tandem with the police.\n\n6. Several other measures to create general aware-\nness about copyright and for encouraging study\nof intellectual property rights in the educational\nsystem, besides modernizing the Copyright Of-\nfice, are on the anvil.\n\nConsequent to the number of measures initiated by\nthe government, there has been more activity in the\nenforcement of copyright laws in the country during\nthe last year compared to previous years.

The number of persons arrested has\nincreased from 794 in 1997 to 980 in 1998. The\nvalue of seizures has gone up from Rs. 28.8 million\nin 1997 to Rs.74.8 million in 1998.
