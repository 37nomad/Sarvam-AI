Jaswant Singh, Minister of External Affairs at\\nIndia International Centre on July 20, 1999\\n\\nMr. Chairman, Ladies and\\nGentlemen,\\n\\nIt is now time to look ahead; to\\nlook beyond Kargil. But even in\\ncharting our course for the fu-\\nture we have to assess what\\nKargil 1999 was all about? What\\nwere the challenges — military\\nand diplomatic? What new fac-\\nets of our total national com-\\nmitment and endeavour\\nemerged? What lessons for the\\nyears that lie ahead? ‘Operation\\nVijay’ — as the Prime Minister\\nsaid some days back — has\\nresulted in ‘Vijay’ for India. As\\nwe re-examine the military and\\ndiplomatic challenges that then\\nconfronted us, and which were\\nsuccessfully managed, we need\\nto have a preliminary analysis,\\ndraw some first conclusions and\\nabove all, looking beyond Kargil,\\ndraw a route chart for the to-\\nmorrows to come.\\n\\nFirst, the military dimension.\\nKargil was a military aggression\\nby Pakistan, with Pak army regu-\\nlars, across a stretch of the LoC,\\nin four pockets, from the\\nMushkoh Valley in the west to\\nTartuk in the Yaldor-Batalik\\nsector in the East. Initially, with\\nthe aggressor — as with all\\naggressors lay the element of\\nsurprise. This was soon coun-\\ntered locally. Initially, the ter-\\nrain, too, conferred some ad-\\nvantage to the aggressor. They\\nhad intruded along ridgelines to\\noccupy some key heights and\\nfeatures that dominated a vital\\nroad link, between Dras and\\nKargil. The depth of the ridge-\\n\\n2 INDIANEWS « August 15, 1999\\n\\nGo gle\\n\\nlines north of the LoC and their\\ngradients, along with nullah ap-\\nproaches enabled the Pakistan\\narmy to provide crucial logisti-\\ncal and administrative support\\nto their troops.\\n\\nThe Indian army’s response to\\nthe military challenge was mea-\\nsured yet swift, it was focussed,\\nthus effective. The first task was\\nto contain the intrusion. For this\\nan accurate assessment was\\nnecessary about the degree and\\nextent of it. This involved,\\namongst other activities the\\ndrawing of fire. Simultaneously,\\na redeployment of troops took\\nplace. Through a successful\\ncontainment of the aggressor’s\\nintrusion was ensured the inevi-\\ntable defeat of this misadven-\\nture by Pakistan. The element\\nof surprise was countered by the\\nIndian army through the speed\\nand lethality of its response. On\\n26th May, the Air Force swung\\ninto action in support of the\\nground operations.\\n\\nOur military objective had been\\nclearly spelt out to the intruders\\nretreat or the Indian army shall\\nevict you. In any event once the\\nintruder’s aim of interfering with\\nthe Dras-Kargil Highway had\\nbeen thwarted the whole ratio-\\nnale of this aggression had got\\ndefeated. A mere holding of\\nheights was militarily a counter\\nproductive venture. They were\\nbound to be evicted — in detail\\n— one by one; for their occupa-\\ntion served scant military pur-\\npose. For India, occupation of\\nterritory, south of the LoC, was\\n\\nsimply not acceptable both\\nphysically and as a violation of\\na principle. Tactical surprise\\nhaving been lost early by the\\naggressor, the military principles\\nof superior force, concentration\\nand firepower were bound to tell.\\nAnd they did, decisively. This\\nphase of eviction did not, in-\\ndeed could not be a phase of\\nbattles of maneuver. The nature\\nof the terrain, the adversary’s\\ndispositions plus most impor-\\ntantly our self-imposed restraints\\nabout the LoC, precluded those\\noptions. The battles for the\\nheights thus became classic\\ninfantry actions in high altitude,\\ncombining mountaineering and\\nfighting, against fixed enemy\\npositions at a higher elevation.\\nThey were actions that de-\\nmanded grit, stamina and daunt-\\nless courage. Our troops dis-\\nplayed all these qualities in full\\nmeasure.\\n\\nLet us be clear about one other\\nvital aspect. This aggression in\\nKargil sector was by the Pak\\nregular army, it had the logistic\\nand administrative support of\\nnot the Pakistani Army alone\\nbut of their total state machin-\\nery. Secondly, this misadven-\\nture was not aimed at infiltrat-\\ning into the Srinagar Valley, it\\nwas to occupy territory in Kargil\\nand in holding that. This pur-\\npose, too, was defeated.\\n\\nThe Kargil aggression is not an\\n\\nextension of the problem of ex-\\nternally aided and abetted cross\\nborder terrorism that we have\\ncombated uptill now. It is an\\n\\x0c'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":7},{"id":"b6ec4ba6-6cc8-48b2-8cf6-ce9e9e675ec0","cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport json\n# Folder containing images\nimage_folder =

The gist of\\nthe Committee’s advice to Government has been to\\nask Government to review the implementation is-\\nsues and prioritise those which are of core interest;\\nto ensure that our implementation demands are prop-\\nerly attuned to our autonomous programme of do-\\nmestic economic liberalisation; to evolve a suitable\\nresponse to a situation where even some of the\\ndeveloping countries are willing to accept some\\nwatered down version of a group on trade and labour\\nin association with the WTO; and evolve our stand\\non environment so that we don’t appear to be against\\nprotection of environment; to give adequate publicity\\nto our positive record of adherence to ILO conven-\\ntions and ongoing efforts for implementation of core\\nlabour standards; and to formulate a national con-\\nsensus on biotechnology etc.\\n\\n(c) The third strand of our post-Seattle approach\\nhas been to participate actively in the meetings of\\nthe General Council of the WTO and its subsidiary\\nbodies to continue to emphasise the areas of our\\nconcern.
